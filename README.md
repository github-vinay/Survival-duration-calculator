# Survival Duration Calculator

## Project Description
This project calculates the duration of how long a person has lived based on their age, displaying the result in different time units (Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds). 

The user is prompted to enter their age and choose a time unit. The program then calculates and displays how long they've lived in the chosen unit.

## Features
- Accepts age input (in years).
- Accepts time unit input (Months, Weeks, Days, Hours, Minutes, or Seconds).
- Handles invalid input and provides feedback.
- Special message for those under 1 year old or not born yet.

## Thoughts During Project Creation
- The goal was to create a simple Python program that allows users to calculate their survival duration in various units.
- I started by defining a basic structure for input handling and output.
- Later, I structured the program into a class to make it more modular and reusable.
- Edge cases like negative age or ages less than 1 were handled to improve user experience.
